strategy:
	1. convert each number separately to binary strings
	2. add the binary strings


1. convertToBinaryStr
	0. initiations
	1. determine how many digits the answer will have (line 8)
	2. use a fixed-length for loop to determine what each empty slot should be


2. binaryStrAddition
	0. initializations
	1. 
	2. an if
